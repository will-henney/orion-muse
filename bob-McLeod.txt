> Section 3.1, Paragraph 2. The density you use was derived from the red
> [SII] doublet ratio. This emission arises immediately at the Main
> Ionization Front and the region very close to it. The furthest (from
> us) emission will come from a partially ionized region (which would
> reduce the ratio N_e/N_H. On the other hand, the theoretical
> expectation of PDR overlain by an expanding photoionized layer
> predicts a rapidly decreasing total density. This makes it hard to
> understand how the [SII] derived N_e values related to those coming
> into play in other layers within the nebula.
>  
> Paragraphs 3-7. Your results indicate that the atomic S/H ratio
> varies significantly across the nebula and in Paragraph 7 you explain
> that this was because of the method of calculation. We don't
> understand why you bother to present something that you acknowledge is
> incorrect. A concise summary in a short paragraph would have sufficed
> and publishing a result and then dismissing it, seems unnecessary.
>  
> Section 3.2. You adopt two diagnostic
> ratios. S_23=([SII]+[SIII])/Hbeta and [OII]/[OIII]. S_23 is not simply
> ionization dependent but is dominated by the electron temperature
> (T_e). The forbidden line emissivity increases exponentially with T_e,
> while the Hbeta emissivity decreases with T_e as the 0.8 power. This

> The [OII]/[OIII] ratio does depend upon the ionization (the ratio of

> In Section 4 on Kinematics you stretch use of these low resolution

> Section 5.1, Paragraph 1. There is an additional bullet in the MUSE
> field, HH 208. This is a tip of a finger pointed almost at the
> observer and is discussed in O'Dell et al. 1997, AJ, 114, 730. This

> In paragraph 2 you say that the bullet cannot be seen at all in [OIII]
